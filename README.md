# Simon Game

## How to Play

- First of all you need to press any key from your keyboard to start the game
- When a key is pressed one of the four blocks will flash
- You need to remember which block flashed and press it with your mouse
- If you were successful you advance to the next level and another, random, block will flash
  - Then, you need to press the flashed blocks as the pattern emerged, from level one till the level you have reached
  - The previous two steps apply recursively if you are successful in pressing the right pattern every time
- If you failed the game starts again from level 0 (I know I'm harsh, but that's life)

## Challenge
